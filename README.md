# ðŸ§  Adi Subbarao - AI Agent Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of AI-powered tools designed to transform how you work with content, research, and automation. As a certified AI Agent builder at MindStudio, I've created dozens of specialized AI agents that solve real-world problems across content creation, research, education, and business operations.

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Adi Subbarao, based in Seattle, WA, where I work to push the limits of what AI automation can do for businesses. With a background from UC-Berkeley in Political Economy and Tech Entrepreneurship, I bring a strategic and humanities driven approach to building AI solutions that actually work for people.

I've dedicated 8+ years of my career to become a strategic product marketing leader with deep expertise across GTM, lifecycle, paid media, and product marketing. I've led acquisition programs, user research, and growth at global tech brands (like TikTok, Amazon, and Servicenow) and smaller AI startups.

**My expertise includes:**
* Growth Marketing
* Lifecycle Marketing
* Paid Media Marketing
* Product Marketing
* Go to Market (GTM) Strategy
* User Research
* Project Management
* CRM & Marketing Automation (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zapier)
* Content Marketing

When I'm not building AI agents, you'll find me sharpening my product marketing toolkit by offering consulting services for B2B clients.

Ready to collaborate on AI solutions or discuss how intelligent agents can transform your GTM workflows? I specialize in:

* AI workflow automation
* Product marketing strategy for AI-powered solutions
* Custom AI agent development
* AI implementation consulting
